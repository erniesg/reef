"""The serving half of the in-process MLX runtime.

Reef splits a deployment into a training runtime and an inference runtime so
that the two can live in different processes. An MLX deployment keeps both in
one, but the split is still real here: exactly one of the two owns the model
parameters, the gate that decides when a request may read them, and the record
of which version is answering. That owner is this class, and training reaches
the engine only through it.

The gate is not a lock around a single call. Activation deliberately leaves it
closed and returns: between swapping the weights and Reef committing the new
head, a request would freeze the old artifact and be answered by the new
weights, which the weight surface rejects as a runtime-load mismatch. Reef
reopens it by committing. So the interface is an explicit ``hold``/``release``
pair rather than a context manager.
