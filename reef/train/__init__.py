"""Training domain: the loop, and the pluggable backends that execute it.

One package, mirroring how a well-scoped training subsystem is usually
organized: a coordinator (:class:`Trainer`) that turns raw records into
reserved, typed batches (``processors/``, ``reef.core.batches``), the recipe's candidate
evaluation that gates each produced update (``evaluation/``), and one
:class:`CandidateBackend` lifecycle. Harness evolution implements it directly;
Weight recipes map their batches through ``RuntimeCandidateBackend`` and delegate
coordination of separate training and inference runtimes to ``RuntimeScheduler``.
The GPU stack is reached by full path so importing ``reef.train`` itself stays light.

``algos/`` turns a reserved batch into a ``StepSignal`` — the same
computation no matter which backend executes it; the recipe's ``StepScheduling``
(``reef.core.batches``) says how the runtime cuts one batch into optimizer
steps. ``evaluation/`` is
the recipe's candidate gate; ``Trainer`` runs it between prepare and settle.

The package does not import recipes or service assembly. ``CordisRecipe``
lives in ``reef.recipe.cordis``. Slime component preparation lives in
``reef.train.slime_backend.driver``; Reef's service layer assembles components
and ``reef.runtime.deployment`` owns their lifecycle. ``tinker_backend`` owns
remote LoRA training, immutable samplers, and checkpoint manifests as a
separate training runtime and inference runtime over one checkpoint store;
SDK imports stay inside its client adapter, and method loss policy remains
in the recipe package.

Tests and deployment configuration stay at repository level, never inside an
integration subtree: ``tests/slime_backend/`` for runtime internals,
``tests/plugin_contracts/`` for package boundaries, ``tests/reef_service/``
for service-facing contracts, with runnable examples owned by their method
packages.
